      <img src="assets/images/WeddingMe.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Chad Dunnam">

      <p>Originally born and raised in a small town in the western part of Texas, I now reside in Chicago.  The first love of mine was music.  I grew up listening to Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Rush, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Rage Against the Machine, and others.  I dedicated my later teen years to studying music and attended the University of North Texas to puruse the further studies of music.  It was here I realized this was a hobby rather than a career.  Not knowing fully what I wanted to pursue, I studied business and attained a BBA in Entrepreneuship.  After a short stint in supply chain, I found I enjoyed the psychology of human behavior in the workplace.  Wanting to puruse this career path, I began a Master's of Science program at Tarleton State University and studied Human Resources.  While attending the program, I was recruited by Mars Chocolate North America to a role in Talent Acquisition Management.</p>

      <p>After nearly three yeras in this role, I applied for an HR Manager role at one of the manufacturing facilities in Illinois and moved to Naperville, IL from Waco, TX in January 2014.  After nearly three years gaining this generalist experience, Mars offered a new role in their new HR Shared Service where I became a Process Optimization Manager.  Upon this move, I relocated from Naperville to the city.  About a year and a half in this position, Mars asked me to start and lead the journey into automation for our HR Shared Service.  This has been new, exciting, and challenging.</p>

      <p>Aside from work, I met my wife in Naperville and we married March 2016.  We have two dogs, "Kazi" our shih-poo and "Smash" our basset hound / sharpei mix.  In our free time, we enjoy experiencing Chicago restaurants and taking Smash to Montrose Dog Beach.</p>
